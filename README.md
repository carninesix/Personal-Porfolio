Expanding on the simple html website

## Project URL
You can find the instructions and requirements, along with the muckups this was based on, on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website "Create a Personal Portfolio Website...") 

## TO DO
### General stuff
- Add breaking point for screens with the width 320px, since it breaks the navbar and the footer start to wrap
- Apparently the "Work Experience" section is just one and is not a different one from "OpenSource work"

### Front page
- Finish setting the Work experience section
- give the work experience section the same background as the Projects list

### Projects

### Articles

### Contact
- Make the inputs more accessible to small screens
